The decks have been cleared for the elevation of Rahul Gandhi as party president later this year in a uniquely Congress way. The subject did not come up during the two-hour discussions of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) here, but the minutes of the last CWC meeting in November 2016 — at which all the members had unanimously asked Mr. Gandhi to take <img src="http://www.gbc.gi/images/site/more-news.jpg" height="425px" width="500px" align="right" STYLE="position:absolute; TOP:720px; LEFT:700px;"><a href="http://www.bbc.com/" STYLE="position:absolute; TOP:1050px; LEFT:880px; text-color:black;font-size:40px;">Click here</a> over the reins of the party after senior CWC member A.K. Antony made the proposal — were “approved” on Tuesday, a senior CWC member told The Hindu.

What was officially “discussed and approved was the schedule for the organisational elections,” that will conclude with the election of the new president in October this year. After Tuesday’s meeting, Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad answered in the negative when he was asked whether Mr. Gandhi’s elevation as president of the party was discussed. To a question about the last CWC meeting that asked Mr. Gandhi to take over the reins of the party, he said, “That was not discussed.” But evidently, the minutes of that meeting were approved.
